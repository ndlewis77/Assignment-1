	 	<h3> What is K2? </h3>
	 	<p> K2 is a synthetic cannabinoid, which combines a plant base of marijuana and added chemicals. Additives are typically unknown and unregulated, and are placed in the drug to enhance the effects of THC, a naturally occurring psychoactive in marijuana.   </p>

		<h3> How is it spreading? </h3>
		<p> Big Boy Deli in Bushwick, was shut down several months following a raid by NYPD. An investigation proved that the deli had been used to distribute K2. Police have worked to shut down bodegas across the city, identifying them as the main source of distribution of the drug. </p>

		<p> But the problem still persists. Distributers of the drug are relying on old tactics of hand-to-hand sales that target minority communities mainly in Brooklyn and the Bronx. Lack of resources in housing, education and health services create an “environment of hopelessness,” making them prime areas for drug dealers.  </p>

		<h3> What is being done? </h3>
		<p> Police in the area are focusing their efforts on distribution of the drug rather than trying to vilify users. </p>

		<p> City council is currently conducting assessments on local treatment centers trying to ensure that centers have the resources required to save lives and help prevent further overdoses. Government officials have stressed that they would rather treat users than put them in jail. </p>
